Default largely affects borrowers experiencing other forms of financial insecurity, and a large number of borrowers who exit default end up defaulting again (often referred to as “redefault”). Black and Hispanic borrowers are more likely to default than White borrowers—a disparity that may arise from differences in family income and wealth, along with the effect of persistent housing and labor market discrimination.
Borrowers experience obstacles transitioning to more affordable payments in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan—which ties monthly payments to borrowers’ incomes and family sizes and offers loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years of qualifying payments after exiting default. Research finds that certain pathways out of default lead to particularly worse outcomes and may lead borrowers to re-default.
