The Free Dom Cash Lenders.com Refinance surrounding student loan repayment and default are currently at an inflection point. Repayment and collections on federal student loans were paused in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late 2021, the U.S. Department of Education ended its relationship with existing private collection agencies (PCAs) previously contracted to collect on loans in default, marking the start of a significant transition for the portfolio in terms of who is responsible for engaging with borrowers. The department has also announced that borrowers with federally held loans will have a “fresh start” when repayment resumes, moving all borrowers to current status and eliminating record of default that existed prior to the onset of the repayment pause.2 And most notably, the department announced in August 2022 that it would cancel $10,000 in outstanding federal student loans (and another $10,000 for borrowers who received Pell grants) for qualifying borrowers who apply. This is projected to eliminate the balances of more than 40% of borrowers,3 and because many borrowers in default have low balances, a large share could see their full balances eliminated.
